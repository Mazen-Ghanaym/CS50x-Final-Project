# Project Description

My project is about a website that enables bookstores to purchase books. 

## Features

- The website provides a book search engine based on the Google Books API, allowing users to buy books from Google Books or our website.
- To get started, users can log in using the login form. If not registered, they need to complete the registration process first.
- After logging in, users can use the "Books" tab to search for books, view book previews, and make purchases.
- Clicking the "Buy" button will redirect users to the Google Books website for completing the purchase.
- The "Buy" tab allows users to buy books directly from website owners. Users can search for books, provide additional information such as address, phone number, and desired amount, and complete the purchase.
- Users can also charge their balance on the website using their credit card. The HTML code for charging the balance can be found in `charge.html` in the templates directory.
- The website includes a "Trading" tab to view transaction history, showing information about purchases made, buyers, and dates. The HTML code for accessing the transaction history is located in `trade.html` within the templates directory.
- Admin users have the ability to add books to the website using the "Add" button. Clicking the button redirects them to `add.html`, where they can search for books, modify details, set prices and quantities, and add books.
- The main page features recommended books and categories. Users can switch between categories and choose to purchase or not from the Google Books website.

## Benefits of Using a Book Website

One of the main benefits of using a book website is the convenience it offers. Users can browse and purchase books from the comfort of their own homes, eliminating the need to visit physical bookstores. Additionally, many book websites provide instant access to e-books and audiobooks, allowing readers to start reading or listening right away. These websites often include recommendation engines that suggest books based on a user's browsing history or previous purchases, helping users discover new authors and genres they may not have considered before.
